Preparing the dataset includes:
1- Keep only ST11 genomes.
2- Using complete-genomes: 
    Length of genome
    Nr. of plasmids // Length of plasmids  
3- Annotation of genomes 
    Tool: BAKTA - Outputs a gff formatted output
    I can do this -> Description of real-gene synteny (Gene order data-strcutre, we will use it to later compare when querying the pangenome)

4- Getting the short-reads from these genomes (DONE)
4- QC of short-reads
5- Assemble genomes (Unicycler)
6- QC on assemblies (BUSCO or CheckM - other?)
	a- Remove the ones that are contaminated
7- Summary of assemblies characteristics
	a- L50 / N50 (Unicycler)
	b- Length of assembly
	b- Nr. of contigs
	c- Nr. of dead ends
8- Remove genomes with bad assemblies or with bad Short-reads
9- Annotation of assemblies
	a- Tool: PROKKA
10- Find SNPS using Snippy. Sakai genome as reference.
11- Load data into SnapperDB (Tim's tool)
12- Make a Phylgenetic tree
13- subtype then into STEC I/II, Ia, Ib, Ic, etc. (Ask Tim for scripts)
14- Type the different phages.
